Flight-fare-prediction-using-machine-learning
The main goal is to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in the provided dataset.
final accuracy score after performing data cleaning,data preprocessing,data visualization is 81%.
the given problem is regression problem , I have used 7 models and observed accuracy score.
the following models gives lower Error score
1.DecisionTreeRegressor:-2425.4148691669425
2.RandomForestRegressor:-2034.916376908694
3.XGBRegressor:=1794.5651567460234
After applying Hyperparameter tunning using RandomSearchCV,RandomForestRegressor gives accuracy score which is 82%.
